    <DD> <b>Honda</b>  was the first <strong>Japanese</strong>  automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura, in 1986. Aside
        from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines,
        personal watercraft, power generators, and other products. <strong>Since 1986,</strong>  Honda has been involved with <strong> <u>artificial intelligence/robotics</u></strong> 
         research and released their <u> <strong>ASIMO robot in 2000</strong> </u> . They have also ventured into aerospace
        with the establishment of <strong>GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004</strong>  and the Honda <strong>HA-420</strong>  HondaJet, which began production in
        2012. Honda has two joint-ventures in China: Dongfeng Honda and Guangqi Honda.</DD>
